Assumptions: 
- white - black scale goes from 0 to 255 with black being far away
- width and height pixels are even numbers
- default camera looks in (0,0,1) direction and left side of camera is at (-1,0,0)
- pitch = around y axis, in radians, CCW
- roll = around x axis, in radians, CCW
- yaw = around z axis, in radians, CCW
- depth map image has 0, 0 in the bottom left corner


Considerations:
- make sure rotations about i j vectors are in correct direction, currently assuming right hand rule rotation
